Strategic Vision & Policy Alignment  National vision or strategy framework: *   National Ageing Policy (2010): Aims for social, economic, and cultural re-integration of older persons into mainstream society. *   National Social Protection Policy (NSPP): Conceptualizes social protection as a broad range of actions to respond to vulnerability and poverty, explicitly targeting the elderly.  Alignment with regional/continental/global strategies: *   Not explicitly mentioned in this document.  Policy-practice gaps: *   Significant chasm between policy intentions and on-the-ground implementation due to fragmentation of policy responsibility and lack of legal imperatives. *   The National Ageing Policy lacks ""binding agency accountability"" and ""supporting legislation,"" making its provisions largely aspirational. *   The gap between government policy and implementation has fostered the emergence of a vibrant, but largely unregulated, market-based ecosystem to meet the escalating demand for elderly care services.  3. Economic & Workforce Landscape  Core sub-sectors or domains: *   Healthcare & Social Care (Formal Hospital Care, Private Home Care, Residential/Day Care, Community Health, NGO & Social Services) *   Financial Services (Pension Administration, Wealth Management, Insurance Services, Microfinance) *   Technology & Ancillary (AgeTech & Digital, Housing & Environment, Supporting Services) *   Rural Economy (Agricultural Extension, Self-Employment (farming, trading))  Scale of opportunity: *   The number of Ghanaians aged 60 and over has increased almost tenfold over six decades. The cohort is expected to reach 6.3 million by 2050. *   The state's inability to translate its own well -articulated policies into functioning public services has effectively outsourced the development of the ""Gold Econ omy"" to the private and informal sectors.  Informal vs. formal workforce dynamics: *   Overwhelming dominance of the informal sector: 90.1% of employed persons aged 60 and over work in the private informal sector. *   High prevalence of ""vulnerable employment"": Over half (53.2%) of the employed elderly operate in jobs that lack formal contracts or benefits. *   The informal economy itself serves as the primary social safety net, with older persons being both consumers and predominant parts of its workforce.  Major barriers: *   Fragmentation of policy responsibility and lack of legal enforcement. *   Critical shortage of geriatric specialists and nurses with geriatric training. *   Limited access to formal financial services and social protection. *   Digital divide hindering the adoption of AgeTech solutions.  4.

Ghana Iron Economy 26 June 2025.pdf|"Okay, here is a structured, youth-centered summary of the provided document chunk, designed for ARC's knowledge base:  **1. Context & Objectives**  *   **Country:** Ghana *   **Refracted Economy focus:** Iron Economy (Construction, Manufacturing, Transportation, Utilities) *   **Document type:** Workforce Report *   **Key aims of the document:** To provide an employment mapping of Ghana's Iron Economy to support workforce development, infrastructure planning, and industrial coordination. To identify skills mismatches hindering inclusive growth.  **2. Strategic Vision & Policy Alignment**  *   **National vision or strategy framework:** The report highlights ambitious government initiatives like the ""$10 billion Big Push"" infrastructure plan, development of a West African Petroleum Hub, and promotion of manufacturing. *   **Alignment with regional/continental/global strategies:** (Not explicitly stated in the document but could be inferred that such initiatives are aligned with AU Agenda 2063). *   **Policy-practice gaps:** The report identifies a significant ""policy-to-platform"" gap with the Ghana Labour Market Information System (GLMIS) failing to capture a large part of the job market, especially the informal economy. There is an ambition to create large-scale employment through government initiatives, but the GLMIS cannot connect workers to these opportunities.  **3. Economic & Workforce Landscape**  *   **Core sub-sectors or domains:** Construction, Manufacturing, Transportation & Logistics, Utilities & Energy *   **Scale of opportunity:** Each sector is growing and driving job creation, but the growth is limited by a skills mismatch. Construction is experiencing a shortfall of tens of thousands of skilled artisans. The Petroleum Hub could create 10,000+ jobs (Phase 1), and garment factories are expected to create 27,000 jobs. *   **Informal vs. formal workforce dynamics:** Significant dualism. A relatively small formal sector coexists with a vast informal economy where most Ghanaians work. The construction sector is dominated by an invisible informal ecosystem of artisans. Transportation and Logistics is bifurcating into formal and informal industries. *   **Major barriers:** A structural skills mismatch (high unemployment alongside a shortage of skilled technical labor), the disconnection of the GLMIS from the informal economy, the strategic dilemma in manufacturing between an ""enclave"" and an ""integrated"" development model, the need for green skills in the Utilities sector.  **4. Skills Pipeline & Education Pathways**  *   **University-level pipelines:** (Not explicitly detailed but inferred that engineering and management programs are relevant). Partnerships between technical universities and trade associations (e.g., KsTU and GNAG) are beneficial. *   **TVET/“missing middle” pipeline challenges:** TVET programs are available but need to be updated to match industry demand. There are quantitative deficits (not enough graduates) and qualitative deficits (graduates lack practical skills). *   **Alternative/adaptive entry points:** Focus should be on formalizing the existing informal apprenticeship system. GTVP can also be utilized. *   **Competency requirements:** Welding, industrial mechanics, electrical installation, heavy equipment operation, green skills (solar PV), digital literacy (for transport), and logistics/supply chain management. Soft skills also critical.  **5. Institutional Ecosystem & Stakeholders**  *   **Government ministries and agencies:** Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations (MELR), Ministry of Works and Housing (MWH), Public Services Commission (PSC), Ghana TVET Service (GTVETS), Commission for TVET (CTVET) *   **Private sector actors:** Large construction companies (Micheletti & Co., New Africa Construction), Manufacturing companies (B5 Plus Limited, CBI Ghana, Nestle Ghana, Unilever Ghana, Guinness Ghana, Coca-Cola), Logistics companies (Africa Global Logistics (AGL), OMA Logistics, and Allship Logistics). *   **NGOs/CBOs:** Union of Informal Sector Workers (UNIWA) *   **Universities, research centers, training hubs:** Accra Technical Training Centre (ATTC), Kumasi Technical Institute, Kohene Technology Institute, the Institute of Professional and Entrepreneurial Studies (IPES).  **6. Opportunities & Transition Points**  *   **Key “transition junctures” for youth:** School → TVET, TVET → employment, informal apprenticeship → formal work, lower-skilled informal work → higher-skilled formal work. *   **Emerging occupations and career pathways in the REF economy:** Welders, industrial mechanics, electricians, heavy equipment operators, Solar PV Technicians, plant operators, site supervisors, logistics coordinators, and fleet managers. *   **Interventions needed to strengthen pathways:** TVET expansion and modernization, apprenticeships, recognition of prior learning (RPL), university-industry linkages, strengthening and scaling GTVP. A skills bridge between hands-on transport and high-skill logistics is needed.  **7. Recommendations & Roadmap**  *   **Proposed strategies:** Launch a Skilled Artisan Accelerator Program, formalize the Informal Apprenticeship System, integrate Labour Impact Assessments into infrastructure project approvals, strengthen the use of GLMIS for project recruitment, develop a Joint Venture and Local Content Policy, and establish Sector Skills Councils. *   **Workforce development plans:** Certification programs, updating curricula with green skills, modular training programs that build upon practical experience. *   **Potential for AI-enabled guidance:** Mapping the informal job market and skills, dynamically updating training needs and opportunities. ARC can connect job seekers and employers and provide continuous updates.  **8. Relevance for ARC Tool**  *   **How this document enhances ARC’s career guidance knowledge base:** Provides detailed sector-specific information on Ghana's Iron Economy, workforce structure, and skills demand. *   **Insights for contextualised, youth-centred guidance:** Highlights the importance of the informal economy, skills mismatch, and the need for flexible training pathways. *   **Data/features that can feed into ARC’s Refracted Economies Framework:** Sector skills demand matrix, list of relevant TVET programs, regional employment hotspots.

Kenya Lavender Economy 25 June 2025.pdf|"Okay, here's a youth-centred summary of the provided document chunk, tailored for ARC's knowledge base:  1. Context & Objectives  Country: Kenya  Refracted Economy focus: Lavender Economy (Care Sector)  Document type: Workforce Report  Key aims of the document:  To analyse Kenya's care sector workforce, identify opportunities, and provide a strategic outlook for its development, focusing on both formal and informal care. The report aims to inform policy, investment, and educational strategies to strengthen the sector.  2. Strategic Vision & Policy Alignment  National vision or strategy framework:  Kenya Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Policy 2020 – 2030, Kenya Mental Health Policy (2015-2030) and Mental Health Action Plan (2021 - 2025), Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF). Data Protection Act of 2019, County E-Health Bill (2021).  Alignment with regional/continental/global strategies:  Not explicitly stated, but UHC aligns with global health goals.  Policy-practice gaps:  Challenges in UHC implementation (low enrollment, public mistrust, budget cuts), mismatch between mental health policy and job creation, limited enforcement of labour laws in the informal sector.  3. Economic & Workforce Landscape  Core sub-sectors or domains: Clinical healthcare (hospitals, clinics), community and public health, mental health and psychosocial support, social work and protection, rehabilitation services, specialised life-cycle care (elder care, childcare), ancillary services (pharmacy, nutrition), telehealth, and informal caregiving (domestic work).  Scale of opportunity: The informal sector is the engine of job creation. UHC, the national mental health agenda, and digital health are creating employment demands and are key in understanding the economic opportunity. Investing in care infrastructure drives gender equality and sustainable economic growth.  Informal vs. formal workforce dynamics: The report highlights a ""care deficit"" filled by unpaid women's labour and a dynamic informal sector. A significant portion of care work is informal (domestic work, family care), lacking formal recognition and protection.  The formal sector is growing due to policy changes, but informal work remains crucial.  Major barriers: Skills gaps, lack of formal employment structures in some areas (e.g., psychology), low remuneration for community health workers, implementation challenges of UHC, limited enforcement of labor laws in the informal sector.  4. Skills Pipeline & Education Pathways  University-level pipelines: Aga Khan University, University of Nairobi (School of Nursing Sciences, Institute for Development Studies).  TVET/“missing middle” pipeline challenges:  The Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) is a major provider of mid-level training (diploma level). However, gaps exist in aligning training with market needs (e.g., hybrid skills) and translating training into formal employment in certain fields.  Alternative/adaptive entry points: Private colleges offering specialized training (e.g., for international nursing licenses), experience-based entry into informal care work (nannies, caregivers).  Competency requirements: Technical skills (clinical, digital health), soft skills (communication, empathy, cultural sensitivity), hybrid skills (combining clinical and community health expertise).  5. Institutional Ecosystem & Stakeholders  Government ministries and agencies:  Ministry of Health, Ministry of Labour, County Public Service Boards, Public Service Commission.  Private sector actors: Private hospitals and clinics (e.g., Equity Afia), telehealth companies (e.g., HealthX Africa), digital platforms (e.g., Fundis, Chuuza, GreatAupair).  NGOs/CBOs:  AMREF, MSF, IRC, UNICEF, Health Rights Advocacy Forum (HERAF).  Universities, research centres, training hubs: KMTC, Aga Khan University, University of Nairobi, Kenya Institute of Social Work and Community Development (KISWCD).  6. Opportunities & Transition Points  Key “transition junctures” for youth: School → KMTC/University, TVET → employment (formal/informal), informal care → formal employment (via platformization).  Emerging occupations and career pathways in the REF economy: Telehealth providers, mental health counselors, community health workers, geriatric support providers, disability support workers, digital health specialists.

Context & Objectives**  *   **Country:** Senegal *   **Refracted Economy focus:** Bronze (Agriculture, Forestry, Mining) *   **Document type:** Workforce Report  **Key aims of the document:** *   Comprehensive mapping of employment in Senegal’s Bronze Economy (agriculture, forestry, and mining) for informed policy and workforce development. *   Identify dualities: Modernizing, export-oriented segment vs. vast, informal, vulnerable workforce. *   Provide structured datasets and analytical insights for sectoral planning and evidence-based policy formulation.  **2. Strategic Vision & Policy Alignment**  *   **National vision or strategy framework:**  Plan Sénégal Émergent (PSE), aiming for economic emergence by 2035.  Pillars include economic transformation, human capital/social protection, and good governance. PAP3 (2024-2028) focuses on consolidating gains and addressing youth/women employment. *   **Alignment with regional/continental/global strategies:** UN Cooperation Framework (2024-2028) aligns with PAP 3, prioritizing structural transformation and sustainable food systems. AU's Great Green Wall initiative. *   **Policy-practice gaps:** Significant implementation gap between PSE's modernization ambitions and on-the-ground realities of informality and low productivity.  PSE often treats agriculture and mining as separate pillars, but their interdependencies offer a latent engine for employment that remains underexploited.  **3. Economic & Workforce Landscape**  *   **Core sub-sectors or domains:** Agriculture (rainfed, irrigated/horticulture, livestock), Mining (industrial, artisanal/small-scale), Forestry (formal conservation, informal wood-energy/NTFPs). *   **Scale of opportunity:** Agriculture employs 21.64% of the workforce (2023), contributing ~17% GDP.  Mining drives 32% of exports, contributing 4.72% GDP. Forestry sector not well quantified in national employment data, with main activities taking place in informal sector, supporting livelihoods for a substantial portion of the rural population. *   **Informal vs. formal workforce dynamics:** Over 90% of workers are in the informal economy (95% for youth). Agriculture is almost entirely informal. ASM sector provides crucial economic buffer employing an estimated 32,474 people, many of whom are youth and migrants operating in precarious and informal conditions. Formal forestry sector is small, but informal activities related to wood-energy and NTFPs are vital. *   **Major barriers:** Skills gaps, climate vulnerability (erratic rainfall, land degradation), limited access to productive resources (land, finance, technology), inadequate infrastructure, gender inequality (land rights). Climate change is fundamentally an employment vulnerability. Youth unemployment is a major national concern.  **4. Skills Pipeline & Education Pathways**  *   **University-level pipelines:**  ISEP-Thiès, CFPH-Dakar, UAM (ES2A), USSEIN, ISRA offer programs in agronomy, crop/animal production, farm management, agroecology, water management, and business skills.

Senegal Orange Economy 25 June 2025.pdf|"Okay, here is a youth-centred structured summary of the provided document chunk, formatted for ARC's knowledge base:  1.  Context & Objectives  Country: Senegal  Refracted Economy focus: Orange Economy  Document type: Workforce Report  Key aims of the document: This report aims to map employment opportunities within Senegal’s cultural and creative industries (Orange Economy), highlighting the dualism between the informal and formal sectors, and providing strategic recommendations for inclusive growth. The ultimate goal is to strengthen the sector's contribution to Senegal's economic diversification, sustainable job creation, and international cultural influence.  2.  Strategic Vision & Policy Alignment  National vision or strategy framework: Plan Sénégal Émergent (PSE), aiming to transform Senegal into an emerging economy by 2035.  Alignment with regional/continental/global strategies: UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions; UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artist.  Policy-practice gaps: A significant gap exists between the progressive policies like the Law on the Status of the Artist and the lived realities of creative workers, particularly those in the informal sector, who struggle to access the benefits outlined in the law.  3.  Economic & Workforce Landscape  Core sub-sectors or domains: Music and Performing Arts, Fashion and Textile Design, Film, Television, and Audiovisual Production, Visual Arts and Crafts, Digital and Multimedia, Publishing and Communication, Advertising, Marketing and Communication, Cultural Event Management, Heritage and Museums, and Emerging Digital Creative Roles.  Scale of opportunity: The Orange Economy accounts for an estimated 3.1% of global GDP and 6.2% of all employment. Though specific consolidated data for Senegal is lacking, the informal artisan sector alone comprises 80-90% of the industrial fabric and 60% of the active population. The Plan Sénégal Émergent recognizes tourism, cultural industries, and artisanry as sectors capable of generating between 40,000 and 125,000 jobs.  Informal vs. formal workforce dynamics: The workforce is characterized by a large, resilient informal sector, a rapidly professionalizing formal sector, and a growing number of globally-connected digital freelancers. The informal sector is the primary engine of grassroots employment, while the formal sector is more structured and benefits from national cultural institutions and forward-looking policies.  Major barriers: Informality, limited access to finance, concentration of opportunities in Dakar, skills gaps (digital literacy, creative entrepreneurship, financial management, intellectual property rights), infrastructure challenges, and institutional weaknesses.  4.

South Africa Lavender Economy 25 June 2025.pdf|"Okay, here's the youth-centred summary of the South Africa Lavender Economy document, structured for ARC's knowledge base:  **1. Context & Objectives**  *   **Country:** South Africa *   **Refracted Economy focus:** Lavender Economy (Care Sector) *   **Document type:** National Employment and Workforce Development Analysis *   **Key aims of the document:**     *   To provide a comprehensive analysis of the employment landscape within South Africa's Lavender Economy (paid and unpaid care work).     *   To identify challenges and opportunities for workforce development in the care sector.     *   To offer actionable recommendations for policymakers, training institutions, employers, and investors.  **2. Strategic Vision & Policy Alignment**  *   **National vision or strategy framework:** The document implicitly aligns with the National Development Plan (NDP) through its focus on addressing social challenges like poverty, GBV, and vulnerable populations, which the NDP targets via the DSD (Department of Social Development). *   **Alignment with regional/continental/global strategies:** The document aligns with global goals related to gender equality and decent work (e.g., UN Sustainable Development Goals). *   **Policy-practice gaps:** The report highlights the problem of ""unfunded mandates,"" where ambitious policies like the ECD 2030 Strategy and the CHW program are not adequately supported by investment in training and professionalization. The minimum wage is another instance of policy and practice failing to align because many employers are in non-compliance and because of the rising cost of living for employees.  **3. Economic & Workforce Landscape**  *   **Core sub-sectors or domains:** Domestic work, health (nursing, allied health, community health workers), education, early childhood development (ECD), social work, elder care, disability services. *   **Scale of opportunity:** The paid Lavender Economy accounts for approximately 2 million jobs (13.8% of all employment in South Africa). The care economy is projected to be the world's fastest-growing work sector. *   **Informal vs. formal workforce dynamics:** Significant divide. Formal sectors (nursing, social work) have clear pathways, while informal/semi-formal sectors (domestic work, ECD, community health) are characterized by precarity, low pay, and limited career progression. Domestic work is the biggest sub-sector, yet the most precarious with the most job losses. Unpaid care is a major component and is disproportionately done by women, which limits their economic participation. *   **Major barriers:** Skills gaps, ""articulation gap"" (difficulty for vocational workers to progress to formal roles), low pay, lack of standardized training (especially for CHWs), policy-practice gaps, and the structural decline in the domestic work sub-sector.  **4. Skills Pipeline & Education Pathways**  *   **University-level pipelines:** Bachelor of Social Work, Diploma or Bachelor's Degree in Nursing, allied health degrees (e.g., Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy). *   **TVET/“missing middle” pipeline challenges:** ECD sector has fragmented training at NQF Levels 4 and 5, but lacks pathways to NQF 6 and 7. CHW training is inconsistent and not standardized. A general ""articulation gap"" prevents progression from vocational qualifications to formal professional roles. *   **Alternative/adaptive entry points:** ""Volunteer-to-paid"" pathway in community-based NPOs. Caregiver training is often based on short courses or on-the-job experience. *   **Competency requirements:**     *   *Technical Skills:* Geriatric protocols, wound management, ECD curriculum design, psychosocial assessment, telehealth platform usage, health promotion, medication administration.     *   *Digital Skills:* Telehealth platforms, electronic health records, client databases.     *   *Soft Skills:* Empathy, communication, resilience, teamwork, problem-solving, cultural competence.  **5.
