# Educational and Career Guidance Chatbot with ChromaDB and RAG

## Overview
This application is an AI-powered educational and career guidance chatbot that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChromaDB and Google's Gemini API. The chatbot provides personalized guidance on education planning, career development, skills training, and financial aid by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base of PDF documents.

## Features
- Interactive web-based chat interface
- Category-based guidance (Education, Career, Skills, Finance)
- Context-aware responses using RAG technology
- Document retrieval from PDF knowledge base
- Conversation history tracking
- Suggested questions for each category
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Flask Web Application**: Provides the backend server and API endpoints
2. **ChromaDB**: Vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings
3. **Google Gemini API**: Generates embeddings and AI responses
4. **RAG Implementation**: Retrieves relevant context from documents to enhance AI responses
5. **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface

### Data Flow
1. User sends a question through the web interface
2. The question is embedded and used to query ChromaDB for relevant documents
3. Retrieved documents are combined with the conversation history
4. This context is sent to the Gemini API to generate a response
5. The response is returned to the user and stored in the conversation history
